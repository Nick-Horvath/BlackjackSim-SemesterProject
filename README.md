code submit 1 - 
Not much to comment on here. Needs to be finished. 

Update 2 - 
Finished the simulation in a satisfactory manner. It now allows for reasonably accurate hands of blackjack to be played, but there are
some problems that need to be addressed. When the dealer checks for naturals needs to be tweaked, some of the rules need clarifying, and
the face cards/aces need proper representing. I am proud of what i have accomplished so far, a functioning blackjack sim, and plan 
to start working on a UI and work out the kinks as i go. If the program remains a simulator for isolated hands of blackjack i will
still be satisfied, but it isnt exactly what i set out to do and i hope to get it as close to a real game of blackjack as i can.
